Q. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
    natural numbers and the square of the sum.

This requires an evaluation of a simple formula:

    (sum_of_numbers)^2 - (sum_of_squares)

sum_of_numbers(n) = n * (n+1) / 2
sum_of_squares(n) =  n * (n+1) * (2n+1) / 6

Evaluating the formula for 100 equals 25164150.
